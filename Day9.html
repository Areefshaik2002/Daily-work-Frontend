    <!-- <h1 class="pseudo">Pseudo-elements in CSS are virtual elements that can be added to an HTML element to enhance its presentation or behavior. They are denoted by a colon followed by a keyword, such as ":before" or ":after". Pseudo-elements can be used to add content, create effects, or modify the layout of an element. For example, ":before" can be used to add a background image or icon to an element, while ":after" can be used to add a PNG or GIF image to an element. Pseudo-elements are often used in conjunction with CSS selectors to target specific elements and apply styles.
